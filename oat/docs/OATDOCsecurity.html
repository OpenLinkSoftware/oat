    <h2> Ajax Security
    mechanisms</h2>

    <p>XML for Analysis methods.</p>

    <p>Under some circumstances (GET requests for JSON-serialized
    data), it is possible for a malicious site to hijack personal
    data. More about this can be found in this document. OAT
    provides support for preventing these attacks. To make your web
    application invulnerable to such attacks, use the
    following:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Shared secret cookie verification - for every GET request
      generated, OAT sets a cookie named oatSecurityCookie to a
      random value. The same value is appended to a query string.
      Server endpoint is encouraged to compare these two values and
      verify that they don't differ. This guarantees that the
      request was made from the correct page.</li>

      <li>JS Traps in returned JSON - to prevent JSON code
      execution, OAT filters out the following text parts from JSON
      data:

        <ul>
          <li>The while(1); construct, located at the beginning of
          JSON text,</li>

          <li>Comments at the beginning and end of the text.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>JSON data providers are encouraged to use one or both of
    these methods to prevent data execution. Such JSON response may
    the look like this:</p>
      <br/>
    <pre>
while(1);/*{[
        {"name":"safe value 1"},
        {"name":"safe value 2"},
        ...
]}*/
</pre>
